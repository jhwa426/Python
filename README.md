# COMPSCI 101 : Principles of Programming

## Course Overview

This course introduces computer programming using the Python programming language. The main focus is on learning to understand the detailed requirements of a programming task, and writing programs that are well structured, correct and easy to read. The course covers simple variables, expressions, input and output, control structures, functions, using standard data structures such as lists and dictionaries, and using standard Python modules.

The course is designed for students who do not have any prior programming experience. For students who wish to continue with Computer Science, this course will prepare them for the core Stage I paper COMPSCI 130.

## Course Requirements

Restriction: Cannot be taken with or after COMPSCI 105, 107, 130, 210-220, 230-289, 313-399

# COMPSCI 130 : Introduction to Software Fundamentals

## Course Overview

This is the entry course to Computer Science for students with prior programming experience. It focuses on the quality of processes used when developing software, and the quality of the software product produced using those processes. The course provides an introduction to fundamental software development techniques and processes, such as reading, writing, and documenting programming code, decomposing problems, testing, debugging, using recursion and handling unexpected errors. It also addresses efficient ways to organize and manipulate data, including sorting and searching algorithms, and writing software that uses and implements common abstract data types such as lists, stacks, queues, dictionaries and trees. The course will be taught using the Python programming language.

## Course Requirements

Prerequisite: 15 points from COMPSCI 105, 107, 130
Restriction: COMPSCI 105, 107
