2. The  first time     he saw   the     island, Marini     was politely leaning over     the    seats
3. on the  left,     adjusting a
4. plastic  table before setting a lunch  tray down.   The passenger     had    looked at him several times   as he
5. came and went with magazines or  glasses  of whisky; Marini     lingered while he adjusted the table, wondering,
6. bored,   if   it    was worth responding to    the passenger s     insistent look,  one     American woman out of many,
7. when     in the  blue
8. oval of the window appeared the   coast of the island,   the golden strip
9. of the beach, the hills  that   rose   toward  the     desolate plateau. Correcting the faulty position of
10. the  glass    of    beer, Marini smiled to the     passenger. The Greek islands,  he
11. said. Oh, yes,   Greece,  the  American woman  answered with false interest. A bell
12. rang briefly,   and    the steward straightened up, without
13. removing the professional smile    from his     thin lips. He began     attending to a
14. Syrian couple, who ordered  tomato juice, but in
15. the tail     of   the    plane he gave  himself a few seconds to look
16. down     again; the island was small    and
17. solitary, and the Aegean Sea    surrounded     it with an intense blue that
18. exalted the curl   of a dazzling     and     kind of petrified white,    which down below  would be
19. foam     breaking    against reefs
20. and coves.  Marini saw that the   deserted beaches ran north     and   west;
21. the rest was  the mountain which   fell
22. straight into   the  sea. A rocky and deserted
23. island, although  the lead-grey spot    near    the northern beach could be    a house,   perhaps a
24. group of primitive houses.    He started opening the  can of   juice,
25. and when   he had straightened up the island  had   vanished  from    the window; only    the
26. sea was    left, an  endless  green horizon.
27. He looked   at his wristwatch   without knowing why;     it was exactly noon.
28. Marini   liked being assigned
29. to the  Rome-Teheran line. The
30. flight was less gloomy   than on  the northern
31. lines,  and  the girls seemed happy  to   go to   the Orient or  to
32. get     to    know Italy. Four
33. days later,     while     he  was helping a  little     boy     who had lost his spoon and was pointing downheartedly
34. at his dessert plate, he again   discovered the edge of the island. There   was a    difference of eight
35. minutes, but  when    he leaned over to    a window in the tail   he
36. had   no doubts; the island had
37. an unmistakable  shape, like     a    turtle    whose paws
38. were barely out of the water. He looked  at it until they called  for     him,   this time
39. sure   that    the lead-grey spot     was a    group of houses;   he managed     to make out
40. the lines of some   cultivated fields    that extended    to the  beach.
41. During  the stop at Beirut he     looked at the   stewardess   s atlas
42. and     wondered if the island wasn t   Horos. The     radio    operator, an indifferent Frenchman,    was surprised
43. at     his interest. All    those    islands   look alike. I    ve  been doing    this     route     for two years,
44. and   I don t care  a    fig    about them. Yes, show it to me   next  time.  It wasn
45. t Horos but Xiros,
46. one of    the  many islands on     the fringe of     the   tourist   circuits.    It won   t   last
47. five years,  the stewardess said to him while they had     a drink in   Rome. Hurry
48. up if you re
49. thinking of going,    the hordes will be there any moment now.     Genghis   Cook is
50. watching.  But Marini
51. kept thinking about the island,
52. looking at    it when he remembered or if  there
53. was a window    near,     almost always     shrugging his shoulders in the
54. end. None    of  it made any
55. sense  flying three times a week
56. at noon   over Xiros   was as unreal as     dreaming three times a   week
57. that he was flying    over   Xiros. Everything was falsified
58. in the futile and recurrent   vision;     except, perhaps, the desire to     repeat it,   the
59. consulting   of   the wristwatch  before    noon, the brief, pricking contact with
60. the dazzling white   band
61. at the edge of an   almost black blue, and the    houses where the fishermen would     barely     lift    their eyes
62. to follow    the   passage    of that   other  unreality.      The island     was   visible for a few minutes,
63. but  the    air was always so   clean, and it  was   outlined by   the sea with
64. such a minute cruelty that   the    smallest  details were    implacably adjusted
65. to the     memory of  the preceding flight. Eight  or nine weeks later, when they     offered
66. him the New York run,     with all its advantages,    Marini thought it was     the chance to end
67. that  innocent   and    annoying obsession. In his pocket he had a guide book     in which
68. an imprecise geographer with a Levantine name gave  more details about Xiros   than
69. was usual. He answered no, hearing himself    as     from a distance, and,     avoiding     the
70. shocked     surprise  of  a
71. boss and two secretaries, he went to have
72. a     bite in the   company s canteen, where Carla   was waiting   for  him.   Carla
73. s bewildered disappointment did    not disturb    him; the southern coast
74. of Xiros   was uninhabitable,   but
75. toward the west remained   traces of a Lydian    or     perhaps Creto-Mycenaean
76. colony, and  Professor   Goldmann had found
77. two stones   carved with hieroglyphics that
78. the fishermen used as piles
79. for the small   dock. Carla     s head    ached,     and she     left almost
80. immediately;    octopus     was the     principal
81. resource for   the handful of   inhabitants, every five  days  a
82. boat arrived to load the fish  and
83. leave   some provisions    and materials. In the    travel  agency they   told
84. him he would  have to charter     a special    boat  from Rynos, or
85. perhaps     it would be     possible
86. to go   in the   small boat that picked   up the  octopuses,    but Marini could  find  out about this
87. only in Rynos, where the agency didn t have an agent. At
88. any  rate,   the idea    of spending a     few days on the  island was     just  a plan for
89. his June vacation;     in the   weeks that
90. followed he     had to replace White on the Tunis   run, and then there
91. was a strike, and   Carla went     back  to her    sisters  house in
92. Palermo.   Marini went     to live   in a hotel near the   Piazza Navona, where
93. there   were secondhand     bookstores;    he    amused himself not very enthusiastically by    looking   for books on     Greece,    and
94. from time to   time he leafed    through a  conversation manual. The word   kalimera pleased    him,   and
95. he tried  it     out on a redhead in a cabaret; he went     to    bed with
96. her, learned     about    her   grandfather in Odos and about
97. certain unaccountable sore   throats.   In
98. Rome   it rained, in   Beirut Tania
99. was always     waiting for     him;     there  were  other stories, always
100. relatives or sore throats;    one day it     was
101. again   the    Teheran run,  the island at   noon. Marini stayed glued   to the
102. window so    long that the new stewardess considered him
103. a     poor partner and let him  know how  many
104. trays    she     had served. That   night Marini invited
105. the stewardess for  dinner  at the  Firouz,     and it
106. wasn   t difficult   to
107. make    her forgive   him for the  morning s distraction. Lucía advised    him to   have his hair cut American-style;     he
108. talked   to her about   Xiros for a   while, but later he realized she
109. preferred   the vodka-lime of
110. the Hilton. Time passed in
111. things like that,   in  infinite trays of food,  each one with the    smile to which
112. the passenger had the right. On the  return trips the plane flew over   Xiros     at
113. eight     in the morning; the sun
114. glared against the larboard    windows, and you could   scarcely see
115. the golden turtle; Marini preferred to   wait    for     the noons of the  trip going, knowing that   then he
116. could    stay a long     minute against  the  window,  while Lucía    (and   then
117. Felisa)     somewhat ironically     took care of
118. things.  Once he took    a picture of Xiros, but   it came   out
119. blurred; he already    knew some things    about    the island, he     had   underlined
120. the rare    mentions in a couple of books.     Felisa
121. told him that     the pilots called him the madman of the island, but that    didn t    bother him. Carla
122. had   just written that she
123. had decided not  to    have    the baby,  and     Marini  sent her two
124. weeks  wages     and  thought    that the rest would not
125. be   enough for   his vacation. Carla     accepted the money     and     let
126. him know     through a friend   that
127. she d     probably marry the  dentist
128. from     Treviso. Everything    had such little
129. importance at noon, on   Mondays     and Thursdays    and Saturdays
130. (twice a month   on Sundays).  Everything
131. had such little importance  at
132. noon,   on Mondays  and Thursdays and
133. Saturdays    (twice    a    month  on   Sundays).   As time went on, he
134. began to   realize that Felisa was the     only     one who understood him     a little;
135. there was a tacit agreement    that    she would take    care
136. of     the flight at     noon,
137. as    soon as he  stationed himself by the  tail     window.  The island was visible  for
138. a     few   minutes, but the air    was always so clean, and it
139. was outlined by the     sea with   such a minute    cruelty that
140. the   smallest details were implacably  adjusted   to the memory of    the preceding flight: the
141. green spot of the headland to the   north, the lead-grey     houses,
142. the nets drying on the sand.     When   the   nets     weren
143. t there,     Marini felt   as if he     had been robbed, insulted.     He thought of filming     the passage over   the
144. island,  to repeat the    image in the hotel,    but    he    preferred
145. to save    the money on
146. the camera since there was less than a month     left for vacation. He didn     t keep
147. a  very    strict account    of the    days; sometimes  it was Tania in  Beirut, sometimes
148. Felisa     in Teheran,  almost always     his younger   brother in    Rome,
149. all a bit blurred, amiably    easy and
150. cordial and  as if replacing
151. something    else, filling the     hours
152. before or after the flight,   and  during     the flight, everything, too,     was  blurred and easy
153. and stupid   until it was time     to    lean toward     the tail
154. window,    to feel   the   cold crystal     like  the boundary of an
155. aquarium, where the golden   turtle     slowly     moved in   the thick blue.   That day, the
156. nets were     clearly sketched     on  the     sand, and   Marini could have
157. sworn that the black dot on the left,  at the edge of  the   sea,    was a     fisherman who
158. must have been looking at the plane.   Kalimera,     he absurdly
159. thought.  It no longer made   any sense to wait. Mario     Merolis would lend     him the money he needed for
160. the trip, and in     less than three days he
161. would   be in Xiros. With    his lips    against     the  window, he  smiled, thinking that he
162. would climb to  the green spot, that   he would  enter   the   sea of the
163. northern    coves naked, that
164. he would fish   octopuses with  the    men, communicating through
165. signs and laughter.   Nothing was difficult once decided a  night train, the first boat, another old
166. and dirty     boat, the night on the bridge, close   to     the stars, the taste of anis     and mutton, daybreak
167. among   the   islands. He  landed with the  first lights,    and the captain introduced    him to an old man,    probably
168. the elder. Klaios took     his left  hand and spoke slowly, looking him     in    the   eyes.   Two
169. boys came, and Marini found out     that they  were    Klaios     sons.
170. The  captain   of  the small
171. boat exhausted his     English: Twenty inhabitants,    octopus,  fish, five    houses, Italian  visitor
172. would pay lodging Klaios. The boys  laughed when     Klaios
173. discussed     drachmas;   Marini, too, al- ready friends with the     younger boys, watching the   sun   come  up  over
174. a sea  not   as dark as     from the air,  a    poor,
175. clean room, a pitcher of   water, smell     of sage and tanned hides.
176. Nothing was    difficult    once     decided  a night train,
177. the first  boat, another old and dirty boat, the   night on   the    bridge,    close  to the  stars, the
178. taste of anis  and  mutton,
179. daybreak    among     the  islands.  They left  him alone to     go    load the   small
180. boat, and after tearing   off his traveling clothes and putting  on bathing    trunks  and
181. sandals,    he set out for a walk on the   island. You
182. still couldn t see
183. anybody; the sun slowly but surely   rose, and   from   the   thickets grew     a
184. subtle   smell, slightly acidic, mixing   with the     iodine of the wind. It must  have been  ten when     he reached
185. the     northern headland and    recognized
186. the largest of     the coves. He   preferred    being alone,
187. although he  would have     liked to bathe   at   the     sand beach even better;   the  island impregnated him,  and   he
188. enjoyed it with such   intimacy that   he was incapable of thinking or choosing.
189. His skin burned  from sun     and wind when
190. he undressed to thrust himself  into
191. the sea from a rock; the water was cold   and  did   him good.     He    let
192. a sly  current  carry   him to the
193. entrance  of  a grotto, he returned to    the  open sea, rolled over on    his back,   accepted
194. it all in     a  single  act  of conciliation that    was
195. also a name for the future. He
196. knew without   the slightest doubt that he     would   not leave   the island,  that somehow   he     would stay    forever    on
197. the  island.     He managed to imagine his brother,    Felisa, their   faces when   they
198. found out  he had stayed to live off
199. fishing on    a large solitary   rock. He    had already
200. forgotten  them   when     he turned over to swim toward
201. the     shore.  The
202. sun dried him immediately,    and   he went down toward the houses,
203. where two astonished women  looked  at
204. him before    running inside and closing their  doors. He    waved a greeting in the void and walked
205. down     toward the nets. One
206. of Klaios  sons
207. was waiting for him on
208. the beach, and Marini    pointed to the  sea,  inviting    him. The boy
209. hesitated,   pointing to     his cloth pants and red shirt.    Then he ran toward one  of the houses  and
210. came   back     almost  naked; they dived
211. together into an   already lukewarm sea, dazzling under    the     eleven
212. o clock     sun.     It  wouldn   t   be easy   to  kill
213. the former man, but  there
214. up high,   tense with sun and    space, he     felt the enterprise was   possible. Drying himself in
215. the  sand,   Ionas     began  to name things. Kalimera,       Marini said, and
216. the     boy doubled over   with laughter. Then Marini
217. repeated the  new sentences, teaching Ionas  Italian words. Almost    on the horizon the small boat  grew smaller and  smaller;
218. Marini felt that now he    was really     alone on the island with Klaios    and his   people. He
219. would let     some days pass,     he    would pay for his room  and learn to fish; some afternoon,   when
220. they were well   acquainted,    he would talk  to them    about  staying
221. and working with  them. Getting up, he held out his hand
222. to    Ionas and started walking slowly toward
223. the hill. The slope was steep, and he savored
224. each pause,   turning   around   time and   again
225. to look at  the nets   on the beach, the figures    of the  women speaking  gaily to Ionas and
226. Klaios and     looking at    him askance,   laughing. When he    reached the
227. green   spot   he entered a world where the smell    of   thyme
228. and sage were one   with the  fire  of the sun and the    sea breeze. Marini
229. looked at his  wristwatch    and   then, with     an impatient gesture,     put    it in   the
230. pocket of his bathing     trunks. It wouldn t  be easy
231. to kill the     former man,  but   there up high,   tense with sun and space,
232. he felt  the  enterprise was possible. He was in Xiros, he was     there where he
233. had so often doubted he could  reach.
234. He     let himself fall  back among the hot stones, he endured
235. their edges and inflamed ridges    and looked vertically at the sky; far  away he could hear the  hum    of
236. an engine.  Closing his  eyes, he told
237. himself he wouldn t    look     at
238. the plane; he wouldn t let    himself
239. be contaminated by the worst of    him that once more was
240. going to pass over the
241. island.   But in the
242. shadows of  his   eyelids he    imagined Felisa   with the trays, in that very moment distributing
243. the trays,     and     his replacement, perhaps     Giorgio
244. or someone  new from another line, someone who would also be
245. smiling  as he   served  the wine or  the coffee. Unable    to fight against     all that past
246. he opened his eyes  and sat up, and in     the
247. same  moment saw the  right    wing of  the   plane, almost  over   his    head,
248. tilt unaccountably,     the     changed sound of
249. the jet engines, the almost
250. vertical drop into    the
251. sea.     He rushed     down the
252. hill,    knocking against rocks and  lacerating his arm    among thorns.    The island
253. hid the place   of  the   fall
254. from him,   but he
255. turned     before reaching the    beach and
256. through a  predictable shortcut he     passed     the    first ridge
257. of the hill and came     out
258. onto the     smaller beach.    The   plane s tail     was sinking some    100 yards
259. away,  in    total silence. Marini  ran and dived   into    the
260. water,     still waiting for the
261. plane to come     up to float; but
262. all   you could  see was     the
263. soft     line of the
264. waves, a   cardboard box bobbing
265. absurdly near the place of the fall, and almost at the    end, when it  no
266. longer made   sense to keep swimming,  a    hand out   of     the     water, just for
267. a second, enough time     for Marini    to change    direction   and    dive    under  to     catch
268. by     his    hair   the man  who struggled to hold on to him  and     hoarsely  swallowed     air     that Marini
269. let him breathe without getting too close.  Towing him   little by little he got him to
270. the shore,   took   the body     dressed  in    white in his   arms, and laying him
271. on the sand he looked    at the face full    of
272. foam where death     had     already settled, bleeding through
273. an     enormous    gash in    his throat. What good was artificial    respiration    if, with
274. each convulsion, the gash seemed to open a  little
275. more and   was like a repugnant   mouth that called to Marini, tore     him   from
276. his little    happiness    of such few    hours   on    the island,   shouted to    him between
277. torrents   something he was    no longer  able    to hear? Klaios    sons  came     running  and behind  them    the     women.
278. When Klaios arrived, the boys gathered    around the body     lying
279. on    the sand,  unable to understand how he   had   had the    strength to swim to shore and
280. drag   himself  there bleeding.    Close his eyes,     one of the women begged
281. crying. Klaios looked toward the sea,   searching for    other survivors. But,     as     always, they were  alone on the island,
282. and the open-eyed corpse was all that was    new  between them   and the sea.
